Discover - Filter by Genre

Tip: For TV Show the procedure is similar.

First you need to have the list of Genres with their IDs.

The list of Genre IDs is here, for Movie and TV Show.
get/genre/movie/list - https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/genres/get-movie-list
get/genre/tv/list - https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/genres/get-tv-list

Make an API Request of type get / genre / movie / list
Get the list of official genres for movies.
https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/genres/get-movie-list

For example, the Comedy Genre ID for movies is 35.

Knowing the Genre ID you want, make an API Request of type get / discover / movie
https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie-discover
And use the with_genres and/or without_genres parameter.
More than one genre can be searched using the comma or pipe feature

Also note that a number of filters support being comma (,) or pipe (|) separated.
Comma's are treated like an AND and query while Pipe's are an OR.

//**GET TO SEARCH**/
// fetch("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?query=ciao", options);

// fetch("https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/tv?query=ciao", options);
